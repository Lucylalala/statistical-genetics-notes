## 1. Definition

Consider a single locus with two alleles $A$ and $a$.

- $p = frequency\ of\ allele\ A$
- $q = 1 − p$

## 2. Relation to genotype frequencies

Under random mating:
- $f(AA) = p²$
- $f(Aa) = 2pq$
- $f(aa) = q²$

Thus:
$$
p = f(AA) + \frac{1}{2} f(Aa)
$$
## 3. State space
- $p \in [0, 1]$
- Boundary states: $p = 0$, $p = 1$ (fixation)
- Absorbing states under drift

## 4. Why allele frequency is the natural state variable

- Evolutionary forces act on alleles
- Individual identities are irrelevant
- Sufficient statistic under random mating

## 5. What information is lost

- Genotype phase
- Linkage
- Individual ancestry
