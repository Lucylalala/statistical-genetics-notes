Statistical genetics studies how genetic variation explains
phenotypic variation and evolutionary change.

## Two complementary perspectives

- [[Frequency dynamics]]  
  Focus on how allele frequencies change in populations
  under selection, drift, mutation, migration and recombination.

- [[Variance dynamics]]  
  Focus on how genetic variance structures phenotypic distributions
  and determines response to selection.
## Why use the term "dynamics"?

This note explains why the concept of **dynamics** is used as a
core organizing principle in this vault, especially for
population genetics and quantitative genetics.

## What is meant by dynamics?

In the most general sense, dynamics refers to the study of how
state variables evolve over time under well-defined rules.

A system is dynamical if:
1. It has identifiable state variables.
2. These variables change across time or iterations.
3. There exist rules governing this change.

## Why genetics can be framed dynamically

In population genetics, the state variable is allele frequency (p),
and time is measured in generations. Evolutionary forces such as
selection, drift, mutation and migration define the update rule:

$$
p_{t+1} = f(p_t)
$$

In quantitative genetics, the state variables are genetic variance
components (e.g. $V_A$) and trait means. Their evolution across
generations follows rules such as the breeder’s equation.

Thus, both fields naturally study temporal evolution of system states,
which justifies the use of the term "dynamics".
## Key unifying question

How are allele-frequency changes translated into
changes in genetic variance and phenotypic means?
